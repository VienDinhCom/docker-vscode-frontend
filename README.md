# Docker VSCode for Front End Development

A Docker workspace for `frontend` development using `VSCode Server` on `Alpine Linux` containers. It ensures a consistent development process from `development` to `production` and provides a uniform environment for `frontend` developers.

- üê≥ **Just Docker**‚Äîno local dependencies
- üñ•Ô∏è **VSCode in browser**‚Äîrun and code, no setup
- üöÄ **Effortless dev-to-prod workflow**‚Äîdeploy what you build
- ‚ö° **Consistent environments**‚Äîno more `it works on my machine`

Perfect for fast, reliable, and collaborative frontend development!

You can also include this project as a module in [Docker VSCode for Full Stack Development](https://github.com/VienDinhCom/docker-vscode-fullstack), allowing you to integrate it with the `frontend` and other related services.
